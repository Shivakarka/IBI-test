Output:
```
array 1: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s
array 2: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s
```
Explanation:
-In short, the code creates two arrays: arr1 with characters from "john" reversed to ['n', 'h', 'o', 'j'], and arr2 referencing the same reversed array.
-It then creates another array arr3 with characters from "jones." arr2 is modified by pushing arr3 as an element.
-The final output shows the length and the last element of both arrays.
