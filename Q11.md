The given code has an issue because the initial value for the accumulator is missing in the reduce() method. When using reduce(), we should provide an initial value for the accumulator as the second argument.

To fix the issue, we'll provide an initial value for the accumulator with properties evens and odds set to empty arrays. Here's the corrected code:

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const result = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => {
  if (num % 2 === 0) {
    acc.evens.push(num);
  } else {
    acc.odds.push(num);
  }
  return acc;
}, { evens: [], odds: [] });

console.log(result);
```

To fix the issue, we'll provide an initial value for the accumulator with properties evens and odds set to empty arrays. Here's the corrected code:

````
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const result = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => {
  if (num % 2 === 0) {
    acc.evens.push(num);
  } else {
    acc.odds.push(num);
  }
  return acc;
}, { evens: [], odds: [] });

console.log(result);
```
Output: { evens: [2, 4], odds: [1, 3, 5] }

Explanation:

The corrected code uses reduce() to iterate through the numbers array.
For each number, it checks if the number is even (num % 2 === 0).
If it is even, the number is pushed to the evens array in the accumulator (acc.evens.push(num));
otherwise, it is pushed to the odds array (acc.odds.push(num)).

The output of result will be an object with two properties: evens containing the even numbers [2, 4] and odds containing the odd numbers [1, 3, 5] from the original numbers array.
