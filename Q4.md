Promise chaining is a technique used to solve callback hell. In this promises are chained by .then() method. 
The results from one promise is transferred to the next accordingly.

Example:

```
 let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    resolve("Hello1");
    });
     
    promise
    .then( function (result1){
        console.log(result1);
        return new Promise((resolve,reject) =>{
            resolve("Hello2");
        })
    })
    .then((result2) => {
        console.log(result2);
    });
```

Here we are using the result from the first promise and sending it as input to the next promise. The output will be Hello1 , Hello2
